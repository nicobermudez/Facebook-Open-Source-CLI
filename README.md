# Facebook Open Source

Welcome to your new gem, Facebook Open Source Projects. Here, you will be able to search through Facebook's Open Source Projects by Category to find out details about each individual project. In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/facebook_opensource`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'facebook_opensource'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install facebook_opensource

## Usage

Once installed, you will be greeted with a welcome message and a list of project categories. From there, select a category you would like to explore. Then, you will be prompted with an option to view more details from a list of different projects within the chosen category. Select a project to see more details. Type 'exit' at any time to exit the program or type in "Y" to continue searching through more projects. Happy exploring!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
